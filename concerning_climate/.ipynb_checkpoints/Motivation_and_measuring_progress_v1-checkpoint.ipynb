    "Often when I think about about climate change and what we might do to mitigate it I become forlorn with the hopelessness of it all. It seems so important and yet so insoluble.\n",
    "\n",
    "Emitting large amounts of CO2 gives us an incredible lifestyle. When we emit there is no immediate feedback mechanism – no way for us to directly feel the cost of our emissions. What’s more, the cost is mostly born by other people. The big, immediate benefits and the lack of direct negative feedback make it hard to persuade ourselves, or our governments, to curb emissions. So hard in fact that I think it is tempting to give it up as a bad job and to get on with our lives. We feel like there is no chance our  governments and industries will make the changes needed to meet the Paris Agreement’s aim of limiting global warming to ‘well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels’ – and so we give up.\n",
    "\n",
    "But we shouldn’t. Because 2°C is better than 3°C and 3°C is better than 4°C. I think this is a really key point that gets missed. The more CO2 that gets emitted, the hotter it gets and the worse the ramifications become. The late David Mackay – a hero of mine – described the area under a graph of CO2 emissions against time as being equal to ‘suffering’. The bigger the area, the more suffering. So we should do what we can to limit those emissions and the resulting suffering, even if we suspect that the temperature increase will  reach 2°C.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before looking more into what action we should take I think its worth understanding where we are now. How much damage has climate change already done and how much more might it do? How are we doing in our efforts to reduce emissions? These questions (and my current unemployed and hence time-unlimited status) have prompted me to do some research and some data analysis. On the whole I’ve tried to use open source data sets to produce my own figures. On occasion I have failed to do so and so have replicated other people’s figures – in which case I say so in the caption."

These include: a temperature increase of about 0.78°C from the period 1850–1900 to the period 2003–2012 (IPCC); a global mean sea level rise of about 19 cm over the period 1901–2010 (IPCC); and an increasing intensity and frequency of extreme temperatures and heavy precipitation events in most continental regions of the world (USGCP).\n",

    "These reports also include projections of what impacts climate change will have in the future under different emissions scenarios. The IPCC uses four scenarios called “Representative Concentration Pathways” (RCPs). These are RCP2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 6.0 and RCP 8.5. The numbers in the names represent ‘radiative forcing’ – a measure of how the gases in the atmosphere affect the balance between the energy absorbed by the Earth and the energy radiated back out to space. The bigger the number, the bigger the ratio of radiation in to radiation out – so the hotter it gets.  Specifically the numbers relate to what the radiative forcing would be in 2100 in each scenario. Annual CO2 emissions from fossil fuel use and industry under each of the 4 scenarios are shown below."

    "Adding between 0.55°C and 0.8°C to the reported temperature changes we see that, even if we follow RCP2.6, we might well exceed 2°C of warming by 2010. The scale and speed of warming under the higher emissions scenarios is terrifying. I don't have a good idea of what a further 3.7°C of warming by 2100 would look like but I do have some grasp of the suffering that 0.78°C of warming is already causing ([famine](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/27/world/africa/famine-somalia-nigeria-south-sudan-yemen-water.html?mcubz=1), [flooding](https://psmag.com/environment/how-climate-change-contributed-to-massive-floods-in-south-asia), [fires](http://www.dw.com/en/how-climate-change-is-increasing-forest-fires-around-the-world/a-19465490), [hurricanes](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-09-06/hurricane-irma-was-made-worse-by-climate-change-scientists-say)). Looking at those temperature estimates I vehemently hope that we are well clear of RCP 8.5. With that in mind, let's have a look at the data. For the past few years there has undoubtedly been efforts to reduce our CO2 emissions - what impact have they had? Which scenario do we seem to be following?\n"

    "The RCP scenarios start in 2000. Detailed data on CO2 emissions from fossil fuels and industry is available up to 2015.  We therefore have 15 years of overlap between historical data and ‘future scenarios’. That overlap allows us to figure out how reality has shaped up compared to the scenarios. In the figure below I have plotted historical emissions against the predicted emissions for each of the 4 scenarios. I have replaced the scenario names with the mean temperature increase estimate for each scenario (from  the table above). I find temperature change estimates far more understandable than radiative forcing estimates.\n"

That means that it is not enough to bring our annual emissions into line with those in the lower temperature scenarios. We would need to reduce our annual emissions even more sharply that those scenarios suggest in order to make up for the overshoot we have already committed.  That means that the longer we leave it to curb emissions, the more stringent the emissions limits will need to become. We need to figure out how to dramatically curb emissions and we need to do it soon.\n",

As such I omitted them from this analysis.  In order to see if that omission wa justified I looked at the breakdown of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions.
